  "About": {
    "description": "Prší is a traditional Czech card game similar to other Mau-Mau-style games in Central Europe. This implementation was done during the spread of the Covid-19 disease in Europe in 2020 when many countries shut down their borders and ordered home quarantine for coming citizens. Thanks to a lot of time during that situation and as a result of closed pubs and restrictions regarding public gathering, we can now enjoy Prší in its web variant.",
