  <h2>Prší</h2>
  <p>Prší is a traditional Czech card game similar to other Mau-Mau-style games in Central Europe.
  This implementation was done during the spread of the Covid-19 disease in Europe when many countries shut down their borders and ordered home quarantine for coming citizens.
  Thanks to a lot of time during that situation and as a result of closed pubs and restrictions regarding public gathering, we can now enjoy Prší in its web variant.</p>
